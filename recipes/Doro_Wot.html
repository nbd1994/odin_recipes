  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Doro wat is an onion-based spicy chicken stew usually made during occasions like 
     parties, weddings, birthdays, or any day. It is one of the national dishes of Ethiopia, 
     usually served over injera, spongy Ethiopian bread.</p>
  <P>Don't worry about the length of time required to make Doro wat. 
     It is a low-maintenance dish; once the aromatics are cooking in the oil and spice, you don't have much to do.</P>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Chicken: Usually chicken legs or thighs, cut into pieces.</li>
    <li>Berbere: A spice blend made with chili peppers, garlic, ginger, fenugreek, and other spices. It gives Doro Wot its signature spicy and flavorful taste.</li>
    <li>Niter Kibbeh: A spiced clarified butter used in Ethiopian cuisine. It adds richness and depth of flavor to the dish.</li>
    <li>Onions: Finely chopped onions are used as a base for the sauce.</li>
    <li>Garlic and Ginger: These aromatic ingredients add a wonderful flavor to the dish.</li>
    <li>Tomato Paste: Adds a tangy and slightly sweet taste to the sauce.</li>
    <li>li>Chicken Stock: Provides a flavorful liquid base for the stew.</li>
    <li>Hard-Boiled Eggs: Often added to the stew for extra richness and texture.</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper: To season the dish according to taste.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Marinate the chicken: Rub the chicken pieces with salt and set them aside for about 30 minutes to marinate.</li>
    <li>Prepare the berbere sauce: In a large pot, heat the niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter) over medium heat.
      Add finely chopped onions and cook until they become soft and translucent. Then, add minced garlic and ginger, 
      and cook for a few more minutes. Stir in the berbere spice blend and tomato paste, and cook for
      a couple of minutes to release the flavors.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken: Add the marinated chicken pieces to the pot and coat them well with the berbere sauce. 
        Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken starts to brown.</li>
    <li>Simmer the stew: Pour in enough chicken stock to cover the chicken pieces. 
        Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the stew simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until 
        the chicken is tender and cooked through. Stir occasionally and add more chicken stock if needed 
        to maintain the desired consistency.</li>
    <li>Add hard-boiled eggs: Towards the end of the cooking time, 
        gently place hard-boiled eggs into the stew. The eggs will absorb some of the flavors and add richness 
        to the dish. Simmer for a few more minutes to heat the eggs through.</li>
    <li>Serve: Doro Wot is traditionally served with injera, a sourdough flatbread. 
        Place a portion of Doro Wot on a plate or injera, and serve it alongside additional 
        injera and any desired side dishes.</li>
