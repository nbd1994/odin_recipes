  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Chocolate chip cookies are a popular type of cookie that is made with a dough containing chocolate chips or chunks. 
    They are known for their soft and chewy texture, with a sweet and rich flavor from the chocolate.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Butter: Softened unsalted butter is typically used as the fat in the cookie dough.</li>
    <li>Sugar: A combination of granulated sugar and brown sugar is commonly used to provide sweetness and moisture.</li>
    <li>Eggs: They help bind the dough together and add moisture.</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract: Adds flavor to the cookies.</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour: Provides structure and texture to the cookies.</li>
    <li>Baking soda: Helps the cookies rise and gives them a slightly crisp exterior.</li>
    <li>Salt: Enhances the flavor of the cookies.</li>
    <li>Chocolate chips or chunks: The star ingredient that gives the cookies their chocolatey goodness. 
        You can use milk, dark, or semi-sweet chocolate, depending on your preference.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven: Set the oven to the specified temperature in the recipe (usually around 350°F or 180°C).</li>
    <li>Cream the butter and sugars: In a mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs and vanilla extract: Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract, until well combined.</li>
    <li>Mix the dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually 
        add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
    <li>Add the chocolate chips: Fold in the chocolate chips or chunks into the cookie dough until evenly distributed.</li>
    <li>Scoop and shape the cookies: Use a cookie scoop or spoon to portion out the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
         Leave some space between each cookie to allow for spreading.</li>
    <li>Bake the cookies: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for the specified time in the recipe, 
        usually around 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
    <li>Cool and enjoy: Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 
        a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy the delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!</li>
