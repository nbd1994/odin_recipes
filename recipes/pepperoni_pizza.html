  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Pepperoni pizza is a popular type of pizza that features a savory combination of cheese, 
    tomato sauce, and slices of pepperoni, which is a type of cured and seasoned Italian sausage.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pizza dough: You can use store-bought or homemade pizza dough.</li>
    <li>Tomato sauce: A flavorful tomato sauce serves as the base for the pizza.</li>
    <li>Mozzarella cheese: Shredded mozzarella cheese is commonly used for its melty and gooey texture.</li>
    <li>Pepperoni slices: Thinly sliced pepperoni is the key ingredient that gives the pizza its distinct flavor.</li>
    <li>Olive oil: Used for brushing the pizza crust and adding flavor.</li>
    <li>Optional toppings: You can add additional toppings like sliced onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, 
        or olives, depending on your preference.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven: Set the oven to the specified temperature in the recipe (usually around 450°F or 230°C).
    <li>Roll out the dough: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza dough into your desired shape and thickness. 
        Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
    <li>Prepare the sauce: Spread a thin and even layer of tomato sauce over the pizza dough, leaving a small border 
        around the edges for the crust.
    <li>Add the cheese: Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, covering the entire pizza.
    <li>Arrange the pepperoni: Place the pepperoni slices evenly over the cheese, ensuring they are spread out to cover the pizza.
    <li>Optional toppings: If desired, add any additional toppings of your choice, such as sliced onions, bell peppers, 
        mushrooms, or olives.
    <li>Brush the crust: Lightly brush the edges of the pizza crust with olive oil. This will help give the crust a golden and crispy texture.
    <li>Bake the pizza: Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for the specified time in the recipe, usually around 12-15 minutes, 
        or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
    <li>Cool and serve: Once baked, remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
        Enjoy your delicious homemade pepperoni pizza!
